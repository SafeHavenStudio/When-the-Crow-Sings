Theodore: What the-?!
Theodore: How did you get in here? I locked the front door!
Chance: Hole.
Theodore: What?!
Chance: Hole. There was a hole in the wall. 
Theodore: U G H
Theodore: What do you want? Can't you respect a man's privacy? Who even are you?
Chance: I'm Chance, the new resident. And you must be Teddy.
Theodore: TEDDY?!!?!?!
Theodore: @#%@#%$%^^@##@!
Theodore: Do NOT call me that. I don't know why Jazmyne sent you here but I don't need you looking over me.
Theodore: And my name is not Teddy. It's THEODORE.
Chance: Uh, right. She didn't send me here to spy on you.
Theodore: Oh, really. Then why are you here, exactly? Just here to snoop around? Think 'cause you're new you get to shove your nose wherever you want?
Chance: Isn't that what you're doing?
Theodore: ?! 
Chance: Look I just wanted to know if you knew anything about whatever is going on around here. The old energy grid, the person who roams around at night, anything. 
Theodore: Why should I?
Chance: Because I asked. Nicely. And I went through all the effort to break in through that hole.
Theodore: . . . Fine. But you help me first.
Chance: Are you serious? What is with you people here and making me do stuff?
Theodore: Do you want my help or not? 'Cause if not, the least you could do is get out of here and leave me alone.
- Fine.
	Chance: Fine, whatever. What do you want me to do?
	Theodore: Help me find something good in all of this junk. I've been sifting through it but feathers-
	Theodore: Just do it. And if I figure out that you found something sweet and didn't hand it over, I'll kick your ass.
	Chance: As if.
	Chance: Alright, whatever.
	Theodore: And go through all of 'em, don't slack.
	Chance: I said alright, man.
	=> END
-As if.
	Chance: As if, I've got better stuff to waste my time doing right now.

Theodore: You again?
Theodore: I made my terms clear, either you help me find something in here or my beak is SEALED.
-Fine.
	Chance: Fine dude, whatever.
	Theodore: Help me find something good in all of this junk. I've been sifting through it but feathers-
	Theodore: Just do it. And if I figure out that you found something sweet and didn't hand it over, I'll kick your ass.
	Chance: As if.
	Chance: Alright.
	Theodore: And go through all of 'em, don't slack.
	Chance: I said alright, man.

-No way.
	Chance: No way, bird brain.
	Theodore: ?!?!

Theodore: Took you long enough, what'd you find?
Chance: Um, some paper clips, a USB drive, and this plastic cube thing.
Theodore: Plastic cube thing? Show me.
Theodore: . . .
Theodore: Give that to me.
Chance: Ah ah ah, no way. You fulfill your part of the bargain first.
Theodore: Uuuuuuugh'
Theodore: I don't know anything except that I see that' thing, walking around in the compound center sometimes. I'm sure you've seen it, I don't know what to say except it looks like someone who used to live here.
Chance: Huh?
Theodore: There used to be more people here. Like, not a lot but a few. Over time some of them started to go through ERS and they ran off. That one'
Theodore: It looks like it might be one of them. I can't really remember who, I didn't really talk to anyone when I first got here and it's all messed up. But something about them is familiar.
- This place?
	Chance: What's up with this place? Why's it so far off?
	Theodore: This is the old scientist's place. I never met him but once he disappeared this place got boarded up, and the gate got locked.
	Theodore: I figured since he had his own house that maybe there was something of value up here but I haven't been able to really find anything worthwhile.

- The energy grid?
	Chance: What about the old energy grid? Caleb said that it ran on an alternative power source.
	Theodore: Like I said, I didn't really talk to anyone when we first got here, okay? I don't know anything about it, other than the fact it stopped working when that dick left and we didn't have power for a week. 
	Theodore: After that people stopped slipping away as much but something got weird with the plants.
	Theodore: Sometimes I look over that fence to the east and it glows this scary purple pink. Just like the stuff that comes off that thing. It's hazy, and hypnotizing like..

Theodore: . . .
Theodore: That's all I know. Now give that thing to me.
Chance: Hey!
Chance: Well what about the other stuff?
Theodore: What about it? Do you think I'm up here filing paperwork? Do you see a computer? I don't care, keep it.
Chance: Fine. See you, Teddy.
Theodore: IT'S THEODORE!
