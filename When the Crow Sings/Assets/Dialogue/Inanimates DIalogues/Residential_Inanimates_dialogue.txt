Yeesh, the path here was awful, all these torn down gates. How can someone live out here?...

~ bike_1
A mangled up bike covered in faded stickers. Must've belonged to a little kid..
There's a helmet nearby too, but it's got weeds growing out of it now. At least they practiced safe biking, or whatever.
=> END

~ bike_2
This bike is totally wrecked. Half of it is in the ground, and the other half is torn up by big gnarly gouges. One of the handlebars looks like it'd give me tetanus just by looking at it wrong.
=> END

~ bike_3
A half buried bike.
I bet people liked riding around out here, before this place got closed off and that big creature started lurking around at night..
=> END

~ bike_4
Doesn't look half bad.
I wonder if whoever owned it also owned this grill.
... I wonder if it still works. <color=#813408>Angel</color>'s soup is fine, but something like some grilled fish? That sounds amazing right now..

	It's grillin' time, baby! Let me just..
	Ugh! What is that smell?
	They must've really been out of here in a hurry, because that is the nastiest looking sausage I've ever seen.
	I should probably close the lid before that thing turns me into a zombie or something.

~ penguin_game
Looks like we had a little soccer action going on here.. Soccer ball, crate goal, some numbers for the score..
Penguins were winning a landslide of 3 to 1.
An ice-slide? An avalanche?.. Whatever. Go penguins! Suck it, not penguins!

~ telescope_night
It's a little tough to make out at first due to the streetlamps, but I can make out a little constellation..
Actually, it matches the drawing on the side of the telescope, like a little trapezoid with a tail.
The drawing is labelled "corvus".

A tombstone.. There are claw marks, big gouges where the name should be.
Why would that thing deface something like this?
