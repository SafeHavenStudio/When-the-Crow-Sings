I didn't realise how green it was out here since I came in later in the day... I can see why this guy chose to live out here instead of inside the compound.

	Yeesh, this thing is creepy. I wonder if someone carved it, or if it just looks like that...

~ fallen_sign
Oh yeah, a toppled over danger sign is definitely not a bad omen.

The door I came in through when I got here. It's locked up tight.

Looks like a water mill. I wonder what they're grinding up in there.

Trout, lined up in a row, drying out. Why are they drying them?.. Fish jerky can't be good.

Mm! An axe, left out in the open.

What a cute little gazebo.

Why are these here? Kinda doubt dude is actually rowing a boat anywhere any time soon..

A bed.. Not too big, not too small, but juuuust right. At least, for a guy like him.

~ bear_wardrobe
It's like someone just made my wardrobe twice its size or something, this thing is huge! What is it full of? He doesn't even wear pants.

~ desk
Looks like a work table, I wonder if there is where he whittles or something..
