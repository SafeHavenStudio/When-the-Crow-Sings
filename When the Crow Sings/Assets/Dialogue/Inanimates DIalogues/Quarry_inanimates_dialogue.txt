Made it through that gate without ripping my clothes! Let's see if I can find this <color=#813408>Teddy</color> guy.

	I bet I can use this to get in somehow. Here I come, little piggie.

	Wonder who left this here. Might be useful later..
	But I won't lug it around without need, it's probably really heavy.

Wonder who made this? Better not touch it, seems like it might mean something important..

Eww, still water.. It kinda smells. 
I'm not touching that, no brain eating bacteria for me! I have enough problems with things wanting to eat me right now..

Rocks... rocks.. rocks! Wow look, more rocks!
Would you believe it, even more rocks!
Man whoever ran this place really loved rocks, huh?
Jeez..

I wonder if there's anything good in this box...
And it's rusted shut. What about the flashlight?
Bottom is stuck, button won't press. I should've known, honestly.

~ scary_bush
I can get a good look at this, without that big thing looming around..
Eugh, spiky purple tendrils, hot pink flowers, the leaves look like they've been painted this nasty color..
Maybe I shouldn't walk through these.. might give me something.

I can see through to the next zone over.. like a ghost town, totally empty.

Ooo, pretty.. Sure hope it's just purple because it's purple and not something related to the stuff that goes on at night.

Did some guy get vaporized? Why would boots and a hat just be here like this?
Spontaneous combustion....
