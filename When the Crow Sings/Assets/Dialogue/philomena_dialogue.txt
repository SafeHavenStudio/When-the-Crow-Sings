Philomena: Yes. Hello. Who are you? You're new. I haven't seen you. No, not you.
Chance: Um, I'm Chance. Farida told me that you'd be here, that maybe you'd want to talk.
Philomena: Farida! Lovely girl, Farida. So sweet. Tried so hard. Learned very quickly. Smart girl.
Chance: Right. She said you would know about the old energy source.
Philomena: Hmm.. mm...
Chance: The old power grid? 
//conditional dialogue
Philomena: I know. I know. I know. No. Not the power grid. Something's wrong with the power.
Chance: Wrong?
Philomena: Wrong. Yes, he says there's something wrong with it. It's dangerous. Dangerous.
Philomena: Ohhh, but I don't know what to do. He's gone and I don't know what to do. 
Chance: He's gone? Who?
Philomena: The doctor! It was his. His discovery. His. And he left us here. Oh he left us here. 
Philomena: And I have to stop it. I have to. I have to.

She seems to have become catatonic. Her lips stop moving, and she starts to hum.

She doesn't seem to be responsive. Her finger tips are tapping together, a rhythm that seems in time with her humming.

Chance: Uh, hello?
She doesn't react at all. The hand that isn't tapping the rhythm is clenching on repeat, her knuckles clicking in a smooth cycle.

Her feet shuffle a little bit against the floor as she readjusts. 
She stares off into nothing. She's still humming.

~ philomena_first_int_cont_4
All of the sounds her movements make synchronize, almost like a sad song. Her lip trembles while she hums.

Nothing is going to change. Best to leave her alone until I can figure out how to help.

She seems calmer now.
Philomena: I like that song. I haven't heard it in a while. Not for a long while. Not since...
Philomena: . . .
Chance: Are you okay?
Philomena: Yes. I.. I think you should have this.
Chance: Thank you.
Philomena: Mm..
It's a birthday card.
"Doctor, a year older. Thank you so much for all of the opportunities you've given me. I hope for another year making history with you! Happy Birthday, Philomena"
There is a date scribbled up in the top right corner. 03/15.
