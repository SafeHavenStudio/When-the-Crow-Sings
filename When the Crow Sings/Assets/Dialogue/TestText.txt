Let's test conditions.
if TestingFlag1 == false:
	Hello! 1 was true.
elif TestingFlag2 == 1234:
	Hello! 2 was true.
elif TestingFlag3 == wassup:
	Hello! 3 was true.
elif TestingFlag4 == false:
	Hello! 4 was true.
else:
	Nothing was true. There is no life in the void.
This is ending text.
This is super-ending text.
