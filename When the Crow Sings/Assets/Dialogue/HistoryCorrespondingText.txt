HFAngelTA - <color=#813408>Angel</color> asked me to stir the forever soup for him.
HFAngelTC - I stirred the soup for <color=#813408>Angel</color>, I should tell him I finished.
HFAngelBC - <color=#813408>Angel</color> didn't seem to know anything, but he said I could talk to <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> at the <color=#5b5b1f>Recreational Center</color>, or <color=#813408>Quinn</color> at the <color=#5b5b1f>Greenhouse</color>.
HFBeauTA - <color=#813408>Beau</color> asked me to pick up a delivery of vegetables from the <color=#5b5b1f>Greenhouse</color>.
HFBeauTC - Alright, got the vegetables <color=#813408>Beau</color> asked me for. I should take them back to <color=#5b5b1f>cold storage</color> before they go bad.
HFBeauBC - <color=#813408>Beau</color> wasn't any help, but he said that <color=#813408>Quinn</color> from the <color=#5b5b1f>Greenhouse</color> might know something. He also said the head of security <color=#813408>Farida</color> might know something, and I can find her at the <color=#5b5b1f>Energy Headquarters</color>.
HFCalebTA - <color=#813408>Caleb</color> asked me to rescue some electrical wires from the crows down by the <color=#5b5b1f>south-east gate</color>.
HFCalebTC - I got the wires from the crows, better get back them back to <color=#813408>Caleb</color> before the crows come after me.
HFCalebBC - <color=#813408>Caleb</color> didn't really know anything, except that there used to be a different energy source here. He said I could talk to <color=#813408>Francisco</color> at the <color=#5b5b1f>clinic</color>, since he's lived here a while, or <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> at the <color=#5b5b1f>Recreational Center</color>.
HFJazmyneTA - <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> asked me to clean up the papers on the floor and pin them on the board before disappearing into the baby room. I should help her out.
HFJazmyneTPC - Drawings are locked and loaded, should get these up onto the corkboard over there.
HFJazmyneTC - I got all of the drawings up on the board, and <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> isn't busy anymore. I should see if she knows anything.
HFJazmyneBC - <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> didn't have any concrete information, but talked about someone named <color=#813408>"Teddy"</color> who sneaks out to the <color=#5b5b1f>Quarry</color> sometimes. Maybe he's discovered something out there.
HFQuinnTA - <color=#813408>Quinn</color> asked me to save some seed from the crows outside, they said it should be down by the <color=#5b5b1f>south-west gate</color>. If I do this, they'll help me connect to someone who lives outside of the main compound.
HFQuinnTC - Got the seed bags, better get these back to <color=#813408>Quinn</color> fast.
HFQuinnBC - <color=#813408>Quinn</color> held up their end of the deal and made it so that I can go talk to their friend <color=#813408>Yule</color>, who lives past the <color=#5b5b1f>south-east gate</color>.
HFFranciscoTA - <color=#813408>Francisco</color> offered to share some information if I helped him out, he needs the leaves of three pisspiss(?) flowers. I should be able to find them near the <color=#5b5b1f>north-east gate</color>.
HFFranciscoTC - I got the herbs <color=#813408>Franciso</color> needs, I should get them back to him.
HFFranciscoBC - <color=#813408>Francisco</color> told me a little about the compound before the energy source changed, and mentioned that some people went missing. He said I could try and talk to <color=#813408>Farida</color> at the <color=#5b5b1f>Energy HQ</color> about it, but he also gave me the code for the gate to the <color=#5b5b1f>north-east</color> that leads to the old power substation. 
HFFaridaTA - <color=#813408>Farida</color> gave me some busy work while she thinks, she wants me to help take down the readings on the gauges in the front of the room four times. 
HFFaridaTC - Filled out the stupid paper, I should see if <color=#813408>Farida</color> will talk with me now.
HFFaridaBC - <color=#813408>Farida</color> suggested talking to the local doctor <color=#813408>Francisco</color> about it, I can find him at the clinic. She also begrudgingly informed me of someone named <color=#813408>Phil</color> living outside of the <color=#5b5b1f>south-west gate</color> in the <color=#5b5b1f>abandoned residential area</color>, and gave me a key to open the padlock. 
HFTheodorePT - Seems like I'm not getting in through the front door, I should try looking for another way in.
HFTheodoreTPC - There's a boarded up hole on the <color=#5b5b1f>south-west</color> wall of the building, if I can find something I bet I can break in.
HFTheodoreGI - Got my hands on a pickaxe, I'm sure I can tear the boards off that hole now.
HFTheodoreTA - Bird brain asked me to go through some piles of junk for him. There's three piles in here, better get looking.
HFTheodoreTC - Not sure why <color=#813408>Theodore</color> want any of this junk, but I should bring it back to him.
HFTheodoreBC - <color=#813408>Theodore</color> told me about what the compound used to be like, and let me keep a <color=#a11bbe>USB flashdrive</color> I found. Dude only wanted to keep some rainbow puzzle cube...
HFYuleTA - <color=#813408>Yule</color> seems to want to fish, but only with a fishing rod. He told me I'll need something for the rod, something for the line, and something for the hook. I should be able to find all of that out here in the <color=#5b5b1f>forest</color>.
HFYuleRod - A stick! This should work well as the rod, it's nice and flexible.
HFYuleString - It's like string, kind of. This could work for a fishing line, right?
HFYuleHook - I'm sure this could be bent into a hook for the fishing rod.
HFYuleTPC - I've got all the parts for the fishing rod, I should bring them back to <color=#813408>Yule</color>.
HFYuleTNC - Great, he wants me to test the fishing rod. The river is right there, I'll try to catch one to humor him.
HFYuleTC - Reeled in a big one, I should let <color=#813408>Yule</color> see it so he can cough up some info.
HFYuleBC - Finally! <color=#813408>Yule</color> told me about the guy who used to run this place, and how he left and a bunch of people here got sick. Guy's name was <color=#a11bbe>Simon Petrova</color>, sounded like a real piece of work.
HFPhilomenaTA - I couldn't really get anything from <color=#813408>Phil</color>, it seems like she's catatonic or something... She's humming, maybe turning on some music would help her? There's a casette player here, but it's not working. I wonder if there's anything I can use nearby..
HFPhilomenaBatt1 - Found a battery, could use this for the casette player.
HFPhilomenaBatt2 - Found a battery, could use this for the casette player.
HFPhilomenaCasette - I picked up a casette tape, hopefully it has good music on it. Or at least music, I guess. 
HFPhilomenaTPC - I have everything to get the casette player I think, I should go see if I can get it working.
HFPhilomenaTC - <color=#813408>Phil</color> seems to be doing a little better, I should talk to her now while I have the chance. 
HFPhilomenaBC - <color=#813408>Phil</color> didn't really say anything, but she gave me a <color=#a11bbe>birthday card</color> for someone, I think the doctor she assisted. It might be useful, I'll hold onto it.
