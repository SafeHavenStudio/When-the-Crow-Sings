Caleb: Oh, good (conditional dialogue here). You must be the new resident Farida was talking about.
// Conditional choice here that doesn't show up unless flagged.
Chance: Yep, that's me.
Caleb_Smile: Nice to meet you, I'm Caleb. What's your name again?
Chance: Chance.
Caleb: That's a fine name. Guess I could take a-
Caleb_Wink: CHANCE on you, huh?
- Funny.
	Chance_Angry: Hah. Very funny. Never heard that one before.

Caleb_Smile: :)
Caleb: Well I'm just here doing some solar panel work. I'm our head electrician around here.
: Just like back home...
Caleb_Smile: This place used to run off some other energy source, but at some point it failed and they shipped me out and installed the panels.
Caleb: Came here just for this job. It's a simple one for me.
 . . . ?
Chance: Other energy source?
There's no big water sources out here. No wind turbines..
Caleb: Oooh yeah. I don't know a whole lot about it but..
Caleb_Thinking: If you're curious about it, maybe I could spend some time thinking while you do me a favor?
- Uh, sure?
	Chance: Uh, sure?
	=> caleb_first_cont_2
- Really?
	Chance_Angry: Really? You can't just tell me?
	Caleb_Wink: ;)
	Chance: . . .
	Chance: Fine.

- Not a Chance.
	Chance_Angry: Not a chance.
	Caleb_Smile: HAH!
	Caleb: Well you come back if you want me to slide some knowledge your way, kid.

Caleb_Smile: Great!
Caleb_Annoyed: Now listen. These damned crows are bad enough, weighing down the power lines connecting the buildings and making me do maintenance on the connectors.
Caleb_Annoyed: Then, they started taking my wires! They've been making nests over by the south east gate, near the old quarter. 
Caleb_Smile: If you could go and grab some back for me, I'd be mighty grateful.

Caleb_Smile: Decide to take a chance on helping me out?
- I guess.
	Chance: I guess so.
	=> caleb_first_cont_2
- Ugh.
	Chance_Angry: Ugh.

Caleb_Smile: Already kid, I yield. You did good.
Caleb_Thinking: If you want to know more about the old energy source, for whatever reason, you would probably want to talk with Farida.
Caleb_Annoyed: But I don't think you should have me sending you.. Not that we don't get along! It's just..
- Met Farida.
	Chance: I've already spoken with Farida.
	Caleb: Oh yeah? And was she a bucket of kittens and rainbows?
	Chance_Sad: I don't know if I'd say that...
	Caleb: Yeah. Well, it might not hurt to talk to who I was going to send you to anyway.

- . . .
	Caleb: Well, anyway if you wanted to talk to her..

Caleb: You should probably go to my Francisco. They're science buddies, and he's one of the smartest people I know.
Caleb_Smile: Or if you wanted something less sciency there's Jazmyne. She watches my little princess Calliope.
Caleb_Thinking: She probably wouldn't know it, but I know she has some kid ruffling her fur. Sneaking out past curfew, hopping fences, you know the type. But hey, adventurers learn things, right?
Chance_Angry: That's not really information.
Caleb_Wink: Well you know what they say. It's not what you know, it's who you know.
Chance_Angry: That's stupid. There's only like a dozen people here. Surely you all know each other.
Caleb_Wink: ;)
