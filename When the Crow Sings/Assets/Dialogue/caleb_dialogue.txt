        Caleb:Oh, good (conditional dialogue here). You must be the new resident Farida was talking about.
        Conditional choice here that doesn’t show up unless flagged.
        Chance:Yep, that’s me.
        Caleb:Nice to meet you, I’m Caleb. What’s your name again?
        Chance:Chance.
        Caleb:That’s a fine name. Guess I could take a-
        [caleb_wink]Caleb:CHANCE on you, huh?
        -funny
                Chance:Hah.

        Caleb:Well I’m just here doing some solar panel work. I’m our head electrician around here.
        Chance:This place runs on solar?
        Chance:(something to indicate an inner thought) Just like home…
        [caleb_smile]Caleb: Yep. This place used to run off some other energy source, but at some point it failed and they shipped me out and installed the panels.
        Caleb:Came here just for this job. It’s a simple one for me.
        Chance:(something to indicate an inner thought) . . . ?
        Chance:Other energy source?
Chance:(something to indicate an inner thought)There’s no big water sources out here… Wonder what it was.
        Caleb:Oooh yeah. I don’t know a whole lot about it but…
        [caleb_think]Caleb:If you’re curious about it, maybe I could spend some time thinking while you do me a favor?
        -Uh, sure?
                Chance:Uh, sure?
                        =>caleb_first_cont_2
        -Really?
                Chance:You can’t just tell me?
                [caleb_wink]Caleb: ;)
                Chance:. . .
                Chance: Fine.

        -Not a Chance.
                [chance_upset]Chance:Not a chance.
                Caleb:HAH!
                Caleb:Well you come back if you want me to slide some knowledge your way, kid.

        [caleb_smile]Caleb:Great!
        [caleb_disgruntled]Caleb:Now listen. These damned crows are bad enough, weighing down the power lines connecting the buildings and making me do maintenance on the connectors.
        [caleb_disgruntled]Caleb:Then, they started taking my wires! They’ve been making nests over by the south east gate, near the old quarter. 
[caleb_smile]Caleb:If you could go and grab some back for me, I’d be mighty grateful.
