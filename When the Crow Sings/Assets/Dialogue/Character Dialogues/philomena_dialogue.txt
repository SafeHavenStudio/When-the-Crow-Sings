Philomena: Yes. Hello. Who are you? You're new. I haven't seen you. No, not you.
Chance: Um, I'm Chance. <color=#813408>Farida</color> told me that you'd be here, that maybe you'd want to talk.
Philomena: <color=#813408>Farida</color>! She's lovely, <color=#813408>Farida</color>. So sweet. Tried so hard. Learned very quickly. Smart, smart.
Chance: Right. She said you would know about <color=#a11bbe>the old energy source</color>.
Philomena: Hmm.. mm...
Chance: <color=#a11bbe>The old power grid</color>? 
Philomena: I know. I know. I know. No. Not the power grid. Something's wrong with the power.
Chance: Wrong?
Philomena: Wrong. Yes, he says there's something wrong with it. It's dangerous. <color=#a11bbe>Dangerous</color>.
Philomena: Ohhh, but I don't know what to do. He's gone and I don't know what to do. 
Chance: He's gone? Who?
Philomena: <color=#813408>The doctor</color>! It was his. <color=#a11bbe>His discovery</color>. His. And he left us here. Left us here.

She seems to have become catatonic. Her lips stop moving, and she starts to hum shakily.

if PhilTalk == 1:
	She doesn't seem to be responsive. Her finger tips are tapping together, a rhythm that seems in time with her humming.
if PhilTalk == 2:
	Chance: Uh, hello?
	She doesn't react at all. The hand that isn't tapping the rhythm is clenching on repeat, her knuckles clicking in a smooth cycle.
if PhilTalk == 3:
	Her feet shuffle a little bit against the floor as she readjusts. 
	She stares off into nothing. She's still humming.
if PhilTalk == 4:
	All of the sounds her movements make synchronize, almost like a sad song. Her lip trembles while she hums.
else:
	Nothing is going to change. Best to leave her alone until I can figure out how to help.

Chance: Are you okay?
Philomena: Yes. I.. I think you should have this.
Chance: Thank you.
Philomena: Mm..
It's a birthday card.
"Doctor, a year older. Thank you so much for all of the opportunities you've given me. I hope for another year making history with you! Happy Birthday, <color=#813408>Philomena</color>"
