Phil: Yes. Hello. Who are you? You're new. I haven't seen you. No, not you.
Chance: Um, I'm Chance. <color=#813408>Farida</color> told me that you'd be here, that maybe you'd want to talk.
Phil: <color=#813408>Farida</color>! She's lovely, <color=#813408>Farida</color>. So sweet. Tried so hard. Learned very quickly. Smart, smart.
Chance: Right. She said you would know about <color=#a11bbe>the old energy source</color>.
Phil: Hmm.. mm...
Chance: <color=#a11bbe>The old power grid</color>? 
Phil: I know. I know. I know. No. Not the power grid. Something's wrong with the power.
Chance: Wrong?
Phil: Wrong. Yes, he says there's something wrong with it. It's dangerous. <color=#a11bbe>Dangerous</color>. He's dangerous...
Phil: Oh- but I don't know what to do. He's gone and I don't know what to do. 
Chance: He's gone? Who?
Phil: <color=#813408>The doctor</color>! It was his. <color=#a11bbe>His discovery</color>. His. And he left us here. Left us here.

	She doesn't seem to be responsive. Her finger tips are tapping together, a rhythm that seems in time with her humming.

	She doesn't react at all. The hand that isn't tapping the rhythm is clenching on repeat, her knuckles clicking in a smooth cycle.

	All of the sounds her movements make synchronize, almost like a sad song. Her lip trembles while she hums.

It's a birthday card.
