Jazmyne: Hello! How can I help you?
Chance: Oh, I just wanted to ask you a few things.
Jazmyne_Exhausted: Ah, okay. Ask away.
- Kids
	Chance_Thinking: So, you watch the kids all day right?
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Yes, I do.
	Chance_Thinking: Are any of them yours?
	Jazmyne_Stunned: Oh! Yes, they are, actually. The younger ones.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: They are the ones who wake up and cry so much.. The older kids also find it funny to jostle them while they're napping.
	Chance_Annoyed: I'm sorry, that sounds rough.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: It's tough but.. I'm glad to have them.
	Jazmyne: They're going to grow up to be great little possums! Just like their father.
	Chance_Thinking: Is he around here somewhere?
	Jazmyne_Worried: Ah.. No.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: When we had to leave our compound.. I'm sure you understand.
	Chance_Sad: Oh. Right.
	Jazmyne: It's okay. I'm sorry to drop that on you, I didn't know how else to answer the question.
	Chance: No, it's fine.. I'm the one asking nosy questions.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: It's good to be curious!
	Chance_Thinking: How many of them do you have?
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: Eight.
	Chance_Scared: Eight?!
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: Yeah...
	Chance_Sad: I'll just uh.. Let you rest.
- Your ear
	Chance: So why are you missing some chunks out of your ear?
	Jazmyne_Stunned: Oh! Hah!
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Well, when we had to leave our compound it wasn't exactly a peaceful exit. Someone ah-.. Well.. Took a bite!
	Chance_Scared: Oh jeez, I'm sorry!
	Jazmyne_Sigh: It's alright! You didn't know or anything. It's just a fact of life, it happens.
	Chance_Sad: Right.. Luckily I didn't get any scrapes or scars when I got out..
	Jazmyne_Worried: Oh! I didn't know you had gone through something similar.
	Chance_Sad: Yeah.. Most of our guys were um.. pretty big. Most everyone..
	Jazmyne_Sigh: I'm so sorry..
	Chance_Sad: It's okay, like you said... Fact of life.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Well.. You're here now. Maybe we can look out for each other? Make sure that sort of thing doesn't happen again.
	Chance:.. Yeah, I'd like that. I'm doing my best to stop anything bad from happening.
	Jazmyne: You're already a great team player. If you ever need anything, let me know! I'll always do my best to help.
	Chance_Smile: Yeah, sure.

Jazmyne: Hello again!
- Nocturnal
	Chance: So you're nocturnal, right?
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: Yes, unfortunately.
	Chance_Thinking: So isn't being up during the day like, weird for you?
	Jazmyne_Sigh: It's not the best, but I have to make do.
	Chance_Thinking: When do you actually sleep?
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: When the kids do, usually. I get enough, but it can be quite hard.
	Chance: And nobody else helps?
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Well, when Angel gets home from working the dining tent he usually takes his siblings upstairs, and when <color=#813408>Caleb</color> is finished with his work he comes and collects <color=#813408>Calliope</color>.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: That still leaves me with eight little ones to take care of on my own..
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Sometimes <color=#813408>Teddy</color> helps me out.. 
	Jazmyne_Annoyed: He gets annoyed with them so easily, though. The moment anyone pulls on a feather or touches his jacket, he gets all huffy and leaves.
	Chance_Thinking: His jacket?
	Jazmyne_Annoyed: Yes, it's his prized possession these days..
	Jazmyne_Sigh: They gave him the jacket as we were transferring.. He has a star on the sleeve, he cut it out of an old baby blanket he had.
	Jazmyne_Annoyed: He sewed it on terribly and wouldn't let me fix it for the longest time. I managed to finally fix it up once when he left it lying around. Gave it a good wash too! The thing stank like hot garbage.
	Chance_Thinking: I guess I can see why he'd be upset..
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Yes, it's.. Difficult to draw a line with him. I know why he's so upset, but he can't take it out on my little ones.
	Chance: Right, yeah. Obviously.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: I wish he would just talk with me about it.. Maybe he'd stop all this sneaking around and just settle down..
	Jazmyne_Worried: Soon he will be old enough to not be in my care, and will get placed into a job on the compound.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: The last thing anyone here needs is him being moody and doing his job wrong.
	Chance_Sad: I'm sure he'll come around eventually. Leaving behind your family and home..
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Yes, you're right. I'm sure he will.
	Jazmyne: Thank you, <color=#813408>Chance</color>.
	Chance_Smile: Yeah.
- Childcare
	Chance: So were you like... trained, to take care of kids?
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: Huh?
	Chance_Thinking: Like.. Like I'm gonna get a job based on my skills I have from my compound, right. Did that happen with you?
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Oh, uh.. Not exactly. This compound is a little more formal than my previous one, there I just sort of informally cared for all of the children.
	Jazmyne: When I got here I was assigned the role officially by the compound head, but it wasn't really much different.
	Chance_Thinking: So you didn't get any training? You just know how to do it?
	Jazmyne: Well, I just sort of had a knack for it. Even before I had my own, I was always drawn to helping out with the little ones. It just came natural to me.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Children are always a bit of a handful.. But some people are more resilient to it than others. 
	Chance_Thinking: Mmm I guess that makes sense. 
	Chance: I just helped take care of my siblings, but not anyone else's kids.
	Jazmyne: That's still a big job. I'm sure your parents were grateful for the help.
	Chance_Smile: Yeah I think they were. Besides they weren't super annoying or anything.. It was mostly just playing in the water, showing them how to catch crawfish and keep the iguanas away.
	Jazmyne_Stunned: Iguanas?!
	Chance_Thinking: Yeah?
	Jazmyne: We had iguanas where we were from too! Resilient little guys! Though I can see why you would want them to leave you be, they are a bit handsy with food. 
	Chance_Smile: Oh, that's cool. Did you have crawfish too?
	Jazmyne: No, I have no idea what that is.

Jazmyne: Hello!
Chance_Smile: Hey.
- Kids drawings
	Chance_Thinking: So those drawings you had me pick up, who did all of those?
	Jazmyne: Well, some of them were done by <color=#813408>Angelo</color> and <color=#813408>Angelica</color>, some were by <color=#813408>Calliope</color>. Mine are still too little to draw..
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: And I'm grateful for that.. I've scrubbed enough drawings off the baseboards for a lifetime..
	Chance_Smile: I guess that makes sense, they were mostly focused on bunnies or people. Only other person was you.
	Jazmyne: Was it?.. I didn't actually look at them. 
	Jazmyne_Sigh: You'd be surprised just how many drawings these kids can pump out.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: Sometimes, C.A.N. won't send us new paper because we've exceeded the limit, so I have to take the paper and recycle it myself.
	Chance_Thinking: How do you do that?
	Jazmyne_Annoyed: It's a whole process.. You take the paper and break it down, rip it into little shreds. Usually I let the kids help with that part, keeps 'em busy.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: Then, we put it in a big tub of water and wash it to make sure it's clean, and then we dump it out and fill it with water again.
	Jazmyne: Then we take a screen and use it to make an even layer of the watery pulp! Hang it to dry, and you've got a new piece of drawing paper to be mangled in a day or two.
	Chance: That sounds like a lot of work just for some drawing.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: There's not a whole lot else for them to do around here.. Other than their education, they've read every book C.A.N. sends a dozen times over.
	Chance_Thinking: You teach them too?
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Yes, I do. 
	Jazmyne: I'm.. a possum of many talents.
	Chance: Sounds like you've got your work cut out for you.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: That I do.
	Chance: I'll uh.. leave you to that.
- Movies
	Chance_Thinking: You mentioned a movie night?
	Jazmyne: Yes! Were you thinking of joining us sometime?
	Chance: Well.. Maybe. I've never really seen many movies, the ones we had where I am from we just kinda watched on repeat.
	Jazmyne: What were those like?
	Chance_Thinking: They were like.. lots of cartoons. Singing, talking animals.. But like ones on four legs, not two... Unless you count birds I guess.
	Jazmyne: Oh! That sounds nice.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: Not all of the movies we get sent in are the most interesting for the little ones.. We haven't gotten a new cartoon in a long time.
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: <color=#813408>Farida</color> might be doing it to spite me.. But they've mostly been sending documentaries or old movies. 
	Jazmyne_Annoyed: Some aren't even in color! The kids can barely keep up with those, I'm better off just giving them leaves and telling them to sort them.
	Chance: Oh, uh..
	Jazmyne_Worried: Oh! But you should still come watch them!
	Jazmyne_Exhausted: The little ones love when more people come to watch the movies.
	Chance_Thinking: Does not everyone come?
	Jazmyne_Annoyed: No. Usually it's just <color=#813408>Caleb</color> and <color=#813408>Angel</color>, and <color=#813408>Angel</color>'s parents.
	Jazmyne_Sigh: <color=#813408>Francisco</color> sometimes comes, but he's usually trying to get <color=#813408>Farida</color> to come. And if it's not an educational movie, in black and white, the most boring thing left on this planet! She won't come.
	Chance_Sad: That's.. Unfortunate. I'll come around.. probably. Can we start with the more fun stuff?
	Jazmyne: Of course! Since you're the newest edition to the compound, you'd have first pick next movie night.
	Chance_Smile: Oh, sick.

		Jazmyne_Worried: And was he alright? He didn't look hurt, or anything?

	- Living arrangements
		Chance: Is there a reason that you guys live in here and the singles live down in the lodging?
		Jazmyne: Ah, I'm not exactly sure! I didn't really make the arrangements. 
		Jazmyne_Exhausted: When <color=#813408>Farida</color> got here after the power got all funny and the people-
		Jazmyne_Stunned: Ahem!
		Jazmyne: She decided it was for the best that we move out of the residential area... Too much energy, not enough people, a very smart decision!
		Jazmyne_Sigh: So we packed up our things and she designated that the families would live in the rec center, since it has a big second floor and there are only a few families.
		Jazmyne: Singles live down by the lodging, I imagine because the rooms must be hard to fit little ones into!
		Chance_Thinking: Are the rooms here big?
		Jazmyne_Sigh: Well, no, but they're a deal bigger than those down in the lodging. <color=#813408>Angel</color> and his family stay in the larger room upstairs.
		Jazmyne: <color=#813408>Caleb</color> and <color=#813408>Calliope</color> stay in the other room, where <color=#813408>Beau</color> and his father used to stay..
		Jazmyne_Sigh: Though now he lives down at the lodging...
		Jazmyne_Exhausted: Why don't you ask <color=#813408>Farida</color> about it? I um.. I'm a little tired and I'm not sure why administrative decisions get made.
		Chance_Thinking: Where do you stay?
		Jazmyne: Down here, in the room I ran off to. It's the largest room because... well.. so many little ones! The ones who aren't mine go upstairs for bed during the night.
		Chance: Ah.. right. Interesting!

		Jazmyne_Sigh: We came here from the same compound. His mother and father.. his siblings.. Well, I'm all he's got.
		Jazmyne_Exhausted: Though he seems to be pretty upset about that.
		Chance_Sad: Ah.. He must be having a hard time.
		Jazmyne_Worried: Of course he is! But we all are!
		Jazmyne_Sigh: I just wish he could see that this didn't just affect him. His mother was my friend, she helped me when I had my litter..
		Chance_Sad: I'm sure.. he'll come around. Eventually..
		Jazmyne_Exhausted: I know he will.. He just needs to mature a little bit.. Once he molts and gets his adult feathers come in, he will need to get over it.
		Jazmyne_Worried: I can't imagine him taking this attitude to <color=#813408>Farida</color> when he needs to do work around here.. She won't put up for it!
		Chance_Scared: I sure hope she can put up with me when I need to get placed into a job.
