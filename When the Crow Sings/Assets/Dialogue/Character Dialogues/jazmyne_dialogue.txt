Jazmyne: Oh! You did what I asked you to!

Jazmyne: Oh, I remember! Lately, I couldn't tell you what goes on at night. I'm kept up at all hours helping with the little ones.

Jazmyne_Exhausted: I'm not sure what he's looking for out there exactly, but lately he's there almost every day. He's probably still out there now. Maybe you can get more out of him than I can.. 
Jazmyne_Annoyed: I don't even know how he gets out there! I mean, the door is broken.
Jazmyne_Stunned: Do you think he can actually fly?
Chance: Uh... Thanks for the info. I appreciate it.
Jazmyne: Of course! You know... if you're used to little ones, I could always use a hand. Oh! We all get together for movies on Wednesdays! If you're interested?
