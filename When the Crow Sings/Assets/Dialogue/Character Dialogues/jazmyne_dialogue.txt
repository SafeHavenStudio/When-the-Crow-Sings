Jazmyne_Annoyed: Ugh... it took forever to get them back down. The little EVOs have been so fussy lately. They barely sleep at night, and are so cranky during the day. What has gotten into them?

Jazmyne: Oh! You did what I asked you to!

Jazmyne: Oh really? Well I appreciate it so so so much. What was it you wanted to talk about again?
Chance: The-
Jazmyne: Oh, I remember! Lately, I couldn't tell you what goes on at night. I'm kept up at all hours helping with the babies.

Jazmyne_Sigh: But, um, <color=#813408>Teddy</color>... He does sneak through that fence to <color=#5b5b1f> the quarry</color> to the north east. He's been so rebellious since we had to move here. I mean I know it was difficult but-
Jazmyne_Exhausted: I'm not sure what he's looking for out there exactly, but lately he's there almost every day. He's probably still out there now. Maybe you can get more out of him than I can...
Chance: Uh... Thanks. I appreciate it.
Jazmyne: Of course! You know... if you're used to babies, I could always use a hand. Oh! We all get together for movies on Wednesdays! If you're interested?
Jazmyne_Sigh: Though, we are running a little low on movies...
