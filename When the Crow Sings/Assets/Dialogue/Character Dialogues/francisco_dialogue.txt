He only walked through to get to the <color=#5b5b1f>power control station</color>, and he only spoke to his <color=#813408>assistant</color>.

Francisco_Excited: But he's been gone for a long while now. Once he was gone, the power stopped working and the coalition sent us the solar panels along with <color=#813408>Farida</color> and <color=#813408>Caleb</color> to care for them.

		Francisco_Sad: The people would come to me and they'd be coughing up this horrible <color=#a11bbe>pink sludge</color>, and then a week or two later they'd disappear from the compound. I have no idea why, their symptoms didn't line up with ERS or any known conditions.
		Chance_Thinking: So it's only the EVOs that get sick and go missing?
		Francisco_Think: Yes, I think so.. But I can't even recognise.. I mean. If that thing is a person, I couldn't tell you who it is. It doesn't look like anyone I knew.
		Chance_Sigh: You're saying it like it's a question but <color=#813408>Farida</color> seemed pretty sure.
		Francisco_Sad: Would you want to admit that the people you are meant to protect have turned into something like that?
		Chance_Annoyed: No I wouldn't, but I wouldn't bury my head in the sand until something worse happens!

- About your work
	Chance: So, do you like working in the clinic?

	Francisco_Excited: On the one hand, I enjoy helping people and putting my education to work. It's also very quiet here, with the limited number of residents we have.
	Francisco_Sad: On the other, anything other than a checkup usually means something bad happened. Someone is sick, or having ERS symptoms. When a sickness comes in that I can't identify from my studies, that is the worst..
	Chance_Thinking: The purple stuff you mentioned earlier?
	Francisco_Scared: Yes, that's one of them. I've never heard of the symptoms, so I've had no way to deal with it. I used to try and write to the C.A.N. scientific board about it, but they never really helped and then <color=#813408>Farida</color>...
	Francisco_Sad: I never figured it out. Nothing I could do to help them and they just sort of left. I see them sometimes, through the gate into the residential area. But they don't hang around, usually.
	Francisco: Ah, but it stopped happening so much after <color=#813408>Farida</color> took over, so I suppose whatever conclusion she came to must've helped.
	Chance_Thinking: They stopped getting purple sick after she came? What could she have done?

	Francisco_Thinking: She doesn't do anything! That's just how my hair looks.
	Chance_Annoyed: There is no way that is your natural hair, I've never seen anyone with random chunks of different colored hair. And it doesn't go all the way down, near your scalp it's darker!

- Your equipment
	Chance_Thinking: So how do you get the disposable gloves and stuff? They don't look like they're made here or anything.
	Francisco_Excited: When I am close to running out, <color=#813408>Farida</color> sends a message to C.A.N. and they send a shipment of whatever I ask for.
