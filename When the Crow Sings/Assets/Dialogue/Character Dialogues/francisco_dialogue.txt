- Don't get along

Francisco_Excited: You know, this herb is something that has been used in this area for centuries. A long time ago, it even almost went extinct.
- Really?
	Francisco_Excited: Yes! The people here slowly stopped practicing herbalism as it had been labelled "uncivilized" by the people in power. Though you know, it just made room for big companies to sell similar medications to the people instead.
	Francisco_Thinking: It was only after the collapse that people returned to their more holistic traditions. We are lucky it survived all the way till now! Especially with the environment the way it is...

Francisco_Thinking: <color=#5b5b1f>The old power source</color>... The man who took care of it was very cold, and we didn't see him often here. He lived beyond the main compound to the <color=#5b5b1f>north-east at the old quarry</color>. He only walked through to get to the <color=#5b5b1f>power control station</color>, and he only spoke to his <color=#813408>assistant</color>.
Francisco_Scared: His work was very... secretive. I never really understood his <color=#a11bbe>"discovery"</color>, but I know it gave me the chills. That hypnotic pink haze that blurred the horizon to the west, especially at night..
Francisco_Excited: But he's been gone for a long while now. And his <color=##813408>assistant</color> holed herself up in the abandoned <color=#5b5b1f>residential area</color> not long after. Once he was gone, the power stopped working and the coalition sent us the solar panels along with <color=#813408>Farida</color> and <color=#813408>Caleb</color> to care for them.
Francisco: People stopped going missing so much too.
- Going missing?
	Chance_Scared: People went missing?
	Francisco_Sad: Yes, before he left mostly. The compound was never big but, it was a good deal more than we have now. Mostly EVOs..
	Francisco: That's why the <color=#5b5b1f>residential area</color> got closed off, and we all live in here now. Not enough people to upkeep the houses..
	Francisco_Sad: My job is to check for ERS, you know? And sometimes they would have that <color=#a11bbe>nasty pink color</color> to them before they-
