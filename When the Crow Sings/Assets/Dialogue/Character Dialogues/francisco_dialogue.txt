	- Caleb sent me.

- Don't get along.
	Chance: It didn't really seem like they got along well.
	Francisco: Well they're just two very different types of people! Farida takes her job very seriously, but tio is more relaxed.

Francisco: The old energy source, huh? That spooky old purple stuff.. Yes I lived here before the old scientist...
Francisco: Disappeared? It sounds bad but I don't know if anyone really figured out where he went. He was just gone one day.
Francisco: After that-
Francisco: Ay!
Francisco: Ah I'm sorry, I shouldn't be chatting while I have work to do.
Chance: . . . 
Francisco: One of the little EVOs is feeling unwell again. Ach' No signs of ERS, but they've been so restless lately.
Francisco: No me diga' I'm out?!
Chance: . . .

Chance: Um, do you need help?
Francisco: Ah! Yes! You want something, I need something. I need to get a medley put together for the little one, but I'm missing an ingredient. You get me the ingredient, I tell you what you need to know. Sound like a deal?
-I guess so.
	set FranciscoTaskAccepted = true;
	set FranciscoTaskOn = true;
	Chance: I guess so. What do you need?
	Francisco: There is this little pink flower you may have seen around, pipsissewa they call it. The leaves help with some of the discomfort. 
	Francisco: They're a little spiky though, so be careful while picking them. Three plants worth will do, you can find them up by the locked up gate to the north west.
	Chance: Alright, I'll be back.

-Maybe later.

- What to get?
	Chance_Sad: No, I forgot what you said to get.

Francisco: Ah, perfect timing. You've got what I asked for?
Chance: Yeah, here you go.
Francisco: You know, this herb is something that has been used in this area for centuries. A long time ago, it even almost went extinct.
- Really?
	Francisco: Yes! The people here slowly stopped practicing herbalism as it had been labelled "uncivilized" by the people in power. Though you know, it just made room for big companies to sell similar medications to the people instead.
	Francisco: It was only after the collapse that people returned to their more hollistic traditions. We are lucky it survived all the way till now! Especially with the environment the way it is...
	Francisco: Ah! All done! How time flies when you're having fun.

Francisco: I guess it's time to fulfill my part of the deal, no?
Francisco: The old power source... The man who took care of it was very cold, and we didn't see him often here. He lived beyond the main compound to the north east at the old quarry. He only walked through to get to the power control station, and he only spoke to his assistant.
Francisco: His work was very... secretive. I never really understood his "discovery", but I know it gave me the chills. That hypnotic pink haze that blurred the horizon to the west, especially at night.
Francisco: But he's been gone for a long while now. And his assistant holed herself up in the abandoned quarter not long after. Once he was gone, the power stopped working and the coalition sent us the solar panels along with Farida and Caleb to care for them.
Francisco: People stopped going missing so much too.
- Going missing?
	Chance: People went missing?
	Francisco: Yes, before he left mostly. The compound was never big but, it was a good deal more than we have now. Mostly EVOs..
	Francisco: My job was to check for ERS, you know? And sometimes they would have that nasty pink color to them before they-
	Francisco: . . .
	Francisco: Ah- anyway..

Francisco: If you wanted to know something about it, I know the old control substation is standing out there in Zone 1.
Francisco: Though you shouldn't tell Farida, she doesn't like anyone going out past the gates unless they have to.
- She said...
	Chance: She said something about there being old gauges not working in the energy building. Were they connected to that substation?
	Francisco: I suppose they could be. We never really talked about it.
	Chance: I wonder why they were smashed..
	Francisco: I-I'm sure time just got the best of them.

- How do I get in?

~ francisco_task_fin_cont_3
Chance: How would I get in? Isn't it locked?
Francisco: Yes, but the lock is manual, so the buttons should still work. The code is 4663, if I remember correctly.
Chance: Oh, okay. Thanks Francisco.
Francisco: Of course. Um, let me know if you find anything out. It was nice to talk to you.
