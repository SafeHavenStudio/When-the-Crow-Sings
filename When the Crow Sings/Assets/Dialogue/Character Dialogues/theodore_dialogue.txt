Theodore: What the-?!
Theodore: How did you get in here? I locked the front door!
Chance: Hole.
Theodore: What?!
Chance: Hole. There was a hole in the wall. 
Theodore: U G H
Theodore: What do you want? Can't you respect a man's privacy? Who even are you?
Chance: I'm Chance, the new resident. You must be Teddy.
Theodore: TEDDY?!!?!?!
Theodore: @#%@#%$%^^@##@!
Theodore: Do NOT call me that. I don't know why <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> sent you here but I don't need you looking over me.
Theodore: And my name is not Teddy. It's <color=#813408>THEODORE</color>.
Chance: Uh, right. She didn't send me here to spy on you.
Theodore: Oh, really. Then why're you here, exactly? Just here to snoop around? Think 'cause you're new you get to shove your nose wherever you want?
Chance: Isn't that what you're doing?
Theodore: ?!

Theodore: So what if I did, why should I tell you?
Chance: Because I asked. Nicely. And I went through all the effort to break in through that hole.
Theodore: . . . Fine. But you help me first.
Chance: Are you serious? What is with you people here and making me do stuff?
Theodore: Do you want my help or not? 'Cause if not, the least you could do is get out of here and leave me alone.
- Fine.
	Chance: Fine, whatever. What do you want me to do?
	Theodore: Help me find something good in all of this junk. I've been sifting through it but. . .  feathers- 
	Theodore: Just do it! 
	Theodore: If I figure out that you found something sweet and didn't hand it over, I'll kick your ass.
	Chance: As if.
	Chance: Alright, whatever.
	Theodore: And go through all of 'em, don't slack!
	Chance: I said alright, man.

-As if.
	Chance: As if, I've got better stuff to waste my time doing right now.

Theodore: You again?
Theodore: I made my terms clear, either you help me find something in here or my beak is SEALED.
-Fine.
	Chance: Fine dude, whatever.
	Theodore: Help me find something good in all of this junk. I've been sifting through it but. . .  feathers- 
	Theodore: Just do it!

Theodore: Took you long enough, what'd you find?
Chance: Um, some paper clips, a <color=#a11bbe>USB drive</color>, and this plastic cube thing.
Theodore: Plastic cube thing? Show me.
Theodore: . . .
Theodore: Give that to me.
Chance: Ah ah ah, no way. You fulfill your part of the bargain first.
Theodore: Uuuuuuugh!
Theodore: I don't know anything except that I see those <i>things</i>, walking around in the compound center sometimes. I'm sure you've seen them, I don't know what to say except they look like people who used to live here.
Chance: Huh?
Theodore: There used to be more people here. Like, not a lot but, a few. Over time, some of them started to go through ERS and they ran off. Some of them. . .
Theodore: They look like they might be people who used to live here. I can't really remember who, I didn't really talk to anyone when I first got here and, it's all messed up. Something about them is familiar.
- This place?
	Chance: What's up with this place? Why's it so far off?
	Theodore: This is <color=#813408>the old scientist</color>'s place. I never met him but once he disappeared this place got boarded up, and the gate got locked.
	Theodore: I figured since he had his own house... maybe there was something of value up here but, I haven't been able to really find anything worthwhile.

- The energy grid?
	Chance: What about <color=#a11bbe>the old energy grid</color>? I've heard that it ran on an <color=#a11bbe>alternative power source</color>.
	Theodore: Like I said, I didn't really talk to anyone when we first got here, okay? I don't know anything about it, other than the fact it stopped working when that dick left and we didn't have power for a week. 
	Theodore: After that, people stopped slipping away as much but something got weird with the plants.
	Theodore: Sometimes I look over that fence to the east and it glows this scary purple pink. Just like the stuff that comes off that...thing. It's hazy, and hypnotizing like..

Chance: Well what about the other stuff?

Chance: Fine. See you, Teddy.
