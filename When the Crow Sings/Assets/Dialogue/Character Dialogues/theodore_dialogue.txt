Chance: Huh?
Theodore: There used to be more people here. Like, not a lot but, a few. Over time, some of them started to go through ERS and they ran off. Some of them. . .
Theodore_Excited: They look like they might be people who used to live here. I can't really remember who, I didn't really talk to anyone when I first got here and it's all messed up. Something about them is familiar.

	Chance: What's up with this place? Why's it so far off?
	Theodore: This is <color=#813408>the old scientist</color>'s place. I never met him, but once he disappeared this place got boarded up and the gate got locked.

	Theodore_Sigh: Like I said, I didn't really talk to anyone when we first got here, okay? I don't know anything about it, other than the fact it stopped working when that dick left and we didn't have power for a week. 
	Theodore: After that, people stopped slipping away as much but something got weird with the plants.
	Theodore_Excited: Sometimes I look over that fence to the <color=#5b5b1f>west</color> of here, and it glows this scary purple pink. Just like the stuff that comes off that...thing. It's hazy, and hypnotizing like..
