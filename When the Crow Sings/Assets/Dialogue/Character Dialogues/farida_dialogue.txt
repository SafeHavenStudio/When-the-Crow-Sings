- Curious

Farida: Even if I wanted to tell you about it, I couldn't. The gauges connected to <color=#a11bbe>the old power source</color> were broken by the time I got placed here.

Farida_Exhausted: The solar was already up and running. Why do you even want to know?

Farida: The ones who wander around at night used to come through that gate sometimes. She locked herself on the other side of it. She might know more about them, or about what happened here. More than she told me, anyway..
Farida_Exhausted: Just be gentle with her, please. Her mind is not what it used to be, and causing her grief won't do you any good.
Chance_Sad: Okay, I'll try.
Farida: ... Here.
It's a small brass key. The brand name has been rubbed off.
Farida: This will open the padlock to <color=#5b5b1f>the abandoned quarter's</color> gate. I go to check on her sometimes.
