Feels like when I used to fish at home.

Chance: Yeah, if you could tell me. 
Yule_Thinking: I don't really know much about them.
Chance: What? But you said you could tell me something.
Yule: I can. Just not about one, specifically. But I know where they come from.
Yule_Stare: When this compound was established, it was based around <color=#a11bbe>a discovery</color> that had been made. I couldn't tell you what, I don't know much about isotopes or elements or anything like that.
Yule_Sad: But there was <color=#813408>a scientist</color> and <color=#813408>his assistant</color>. They were the reason it was set up, he had discovered this <color=#a11bbe>energy producing anomaly</color> so they built the compound around it.
Yule: Well, not around it physically. 'Far as I know it's a ways off, to the north. But that's why we were brought here. Me and a smattering of other folks. Families, friends. This was shortly after a few other collapses but, it was a while ago. Don't remember the names.
Yule_Stare: Things were fine at first, but pretty quick some folk started going... backwards. You know what I mean.
Chance_Thinking: ERS..

Yule_Sad: Mhm.. Well they sent us that boy <color=#813408>Francisco</color> and they thought they could keep a handle on it. But people started to slip so far back that they couldn't handle it anymore.
Yule_Thinking: Started to get wild. Usually they just ran off before anything happened, but every once in a while something was.. <color=#a11bbe>wrong</color>.
Yule: See, that syndrome us EVOs get usually just backslides you down the evolutionary line, but these people didn't do that. They got <color=#a11bbe>different</color>. 
Yule_Stare: Grew new bits, started hacking up this awful purple pink slime.  After a new batch of people came, that <color=#813408>scientist</color> ran off.
if PhilomenaBaseCompleted == true:
	Chance: And he left <color=#813408>Phil</color> here?

Yule_Stare: That day, the power went out and that grid stopped workin'. Coalition sent out new parts, new people, and everything was getting better. Haven't seen much of the purple ones since. Well, till now.
Yule: And that thing still kicks on at night, humming and glowing. And the plants to the north got that sickly color to 'em.
Yule_Angry: Somehow I feel like it's that bastard's fault this all happened. I don't quite know, but I think that <color=#a11bbe>energy</color> got into 'em. Maybe they woulda backslid, but they'd be normal. 
Chance: Wow.
Chance: You sure talk a lot once you get the chance.
Yule_Smile: Hah! Well, you know what they say about bears.
Chance: What do they say?
Yule_Smile: I was hoping you knew.
Chance_Excited: Pfff!
Chance_Smile: Thanks for telling me all of that. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do anything about it, but I'm sure there's something in all of that that I might be able to use to stop this.

- Talking to fish
	Chance: Quinn told me you talk to the fish sometimes.
	Yule_Stare: Yes.
	Chance_Thinking: Uh.. Why do you do that?
	Yule: The fish.. They die for us to survive. I think that if it were me, you know, dying.. I would like to be talked to a little bit before I go.
	Yule_Thinking: They deserve some respect for helping us live.
	Chance_Thinking: I guess that makes sense.
	Yule_Stare: For a long time, my kind were known for eating fish. Standing in rivers, grabbing them as they hopped out of the water.
	Yule_Sad: None of the sophistication of a hook and line..
	Chance_Thinking: Uh.. Right. So.. You talk to them because you feel bad that they were uh.. just eaten by your ancestors straight up?
	Yule: Mhm.
	Chance: Do you feel this way about.. other things?
	Yule_Thinking: Well... Berries and roots don't exactly have brains or hearts to be stopped.
	Chance_Thinking: Right.. Right..
	Chance: You're kind of an eccentric guy.
	Yule_Stare: Maybe you're the eccentric one.
	Chance_Thinking: Uh.. yeah maybe.
- Prepping fish
	Chance: What do you dry the fish out for?
	Yule: For eating.
	Chance_Thinking: You eat them dry?
	Yule_Thinking: Yes. Sometimes. Sometimes they get added to the soup, so they rehydrate a little.
	Chance: There's no way the fish stays good that long out of water.
	Yule_Stare: It is fairly dry here. I believe our fish stay good dry for a long time.
	Chance: Where I'm from, if they stay out of the water they dry up a little but not completely, and then they smell nasty. We usually eat them right away.
	Yule_Thinking: Oh.. Maybe it was too humid there? Too much moisture in the air?
	Chance_Thinking:... Oh yeah. That makes sense. And you guys have that cold storage so that probably keeps it dry..
	Yule: Yes, it does. 
	Chance_Thinking:.. Right.

Yule: Hello.
Chance: Hey big guy.
- See anything out here
	Chance_Thinking: So, you don't ever see the things that hang out in the compound at night, right?
	Yule_Stare: That's right.
	Chance: Do you ever see anything else?
	Yule_Thinking: I mentioned the plants.
	Chance: Yeah.. Like, other than that.
	Yule_Stare: Sometimes the fish come out a bit funny.. But related to the purple things, I don't think so.
	Yule_Smile: Oh! I used to see that bird boy, now and again. Near the mill. 
	Yule_Stare: Though he hasn't been by in a while.
	Chance_Thinking: Why's that?
	Yule_Thinking: I'm not sure. The last time he was here, I tried to get his attention. I thought maybe he wanted to fish with me.
	Yule_Sad: Haven't seen him since. 
	Chance_Sad: Oh..
	Chance_Thinking: Wait, how did he get out here? The gate is locked and only you and Quinn are allowed through usually, right?
	Yule_Thinking: I'm not sure. 
	Chance_Thinking: Wonder what he wanted out here..
	Yule_Stare: Your guess is as good as mine.. It's mostly just fish out here.
- What you do out here
	Chance: So what exactly do you do out here? Do you have a job like everyone else?
	Yule_Thinking: I used to be the one in charge of the <color=#5b5b1f>cold storage</color> and food preservation. My role was.. dissolved, unofficially. 
	Yule_Stare: I provide the fish because I ought to, not because I have to anymore.
	Yule_Sad: I wouldn't want anyone to go hungry due to my leaving the main compound.
	Chance_Thinking: That's gotta be nice, to not have any rules.
	Yule_Angry: Life's about more than rules. Rules are part of what got us into this mess..
	Yule_Sad: If it weren't for those compound heads and their egos, we might've gotten that mess with the sick fellas taken care of.
	Yule_Angry: But everyone, just like that damn <color=#813408>doctor</color>, they all wanna be some savior and have their name written in gold. Can't just admit when they've mucked somethin' up. 
	Chance_Thinking: It's always been that way? Even when <color=#813408>Farida</color> got here?
	Yule_Thinking: I left 'round the time she showed up. If things got better, I ain't seen it. Those things still stomp around, the plants stay sick, the people are gone.. Far as I'm concerned, until all that stops, it's their fault.
	Yule_Sad: <color=#813408>Farida</color> included.. She might think she's doin' the right thing, but she's a damn fool. Closing up all the gates didn't stop anything, just gave them more obstacles.
	Chance_Sad: Do they ever bother you?
	Yule_Thinking: No, I don't think it wants anything where I am.. I think it's lookin' for something. May never find it.
	Chance_Sad: What do you think happens if it does stop? All the sickly stuff goes away, what do you think happens to them?
	Yule_Sad: I'm not sure.. I doubt somethin' like that can just go back to normal. Maybe it would stay, maybe it'd get mad.. Maybe it'd wander off.
	Yule_Stare: Hopefully whatever happens, if you stop this like you said, it ain't in too much pain.
	Yule_Sad: Was one of us, back then.. I feel ashamed that I don't remember their name. Their face..
	Chance_Sad: It's been a long time.. It's not your fault.
	Yule_Stare: Well.. it's someone's.

	Chance: There's some wood carvings around here, and in the greenhouse. Did you make those?
	Yule: Yes, I did.
	Chance_Thinking: Is that hard to do with your uhhh... Big paws?
	Yule: Maybe a little bit..
	Yule_Thinking: I've been doing it for a long time, so, I suppose I've just gotten the hang of it. 
	Chance: When did you learn to do it?
	Yule_Stare: A long, long time ago. I must've been just a cub.
	Yule: My mother was great with her paws, and was in charge of making utensils and dishes that we could from wood. 
	Yule: She was a good woman, and she made some of the nicest bowls I've ever seen! The wooden ones you see in there, they barely measure up to her craftsmanship.
	Chance_Thinking: That's pretty cool. I learned to fish from my mom.
	Yule_Smile: Ah, a woman with good taste! My father taught me how to fish. The grace, the connection with it all..
	Yule_Stare: It's one of the only things that makes me feel connected to them.
	Yule_Sad: I'm an old bear... and they've been gone for a long time.
	Chance_Sad: Well.. at least you've got something to remind you of them, yeah?
	Yule_Thinking: Yes, I suppose so..
	Chance_Thinking:.. So are they self portraits?
	Yule_Thinking: Huh?
	Chance: The carvings of the bears, are they supposed to be of you?
	Yule_Stare: Do they look like me?..
	Chance_Thinking: Uhh...
	Yule: I suppose they might be.. They say that an artist puts a piece of themselves into their art, right?
	Chance: Mm yeah I've heard that.
	Yule_Stare: They're meant to be wards.. Keep evil away, things like that. My mother believed that keeping totems of.. love and kindness.. something like that.
	Chance_Thinking: That sounds pretty neat. Does it work?
	Yule: Do you see that purple crap creeping into here?
	Chance_Thinking: Oh... I don't think so.
	Yule: Then I think it's doing about the best it can.
	Chance: Mm.. I could use one of those.
	Yule_Stare: I'll make ya one sometime.
- Water mill
	Chance: What is the mill making?
	Yule_Thinking: I don't know, it's been a minute..
	Chance_Thinking: You don't know?
	Yule_Stare: I've got other priorities.. I haven't been told they're low on anything in there. So it's just sort of, going, I suppose.
	Chance: And that doesn't cause anything with the grain or.. whatever?
	Yule: Not that I've noticed.. Have you noticed?
	Chance_Annoyed: Well all I've had to eat so far is soup, which I don't think has any grains in it so..
	Chance: No, I guess not.
	Yule: Then I guess it's all good then.
