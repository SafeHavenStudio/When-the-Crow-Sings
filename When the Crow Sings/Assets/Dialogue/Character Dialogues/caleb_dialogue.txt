- Amount of power
	Chance_Thinking: How much energy do you guys actually get from these? There's lots of trees around and it's really hilly. Isn't that a bad thing?
	Caleb_Thinking: Well, you're not far off. I'm not sure the exact numbers, you'd have to ask <color=#813408>Farida</color> about the specifics.
	Caleb_Smile: But they work well enough I'd say. Don't have any issues with power at night or when the nights get longer in the winter.
	Caleb_Annoyed: Despite what <color=#813408>Farida</color> might harp on about, our energy usage seems to be just fine to me.
	Chance_Thinking: Back home the power would sometimes skip out during the winter because of a lack of sunlight. Weird it isn't an issue here.
	Caleb: Ooo, those musta been cold winters.
	Chance: Not really, I lived on an island. It was very tropical.
	Caleb_Smile: Boy, are you in for a treat.

- Ones on the roofs
	Chance_Thinking: I haven't seen a ladder around, how do you get to the ones on the roofs?
	Caleb: Oh we have a ladder. I just have to haul it out every time to use it.
	Chance: Why not just leave it outside?
	Caleb_Annoyed: Because <b>someone</b> kept taking the ladder and using it to get over the fences into the closed areas.
	Chance_Annoyed: Oh.
	<i>Man it would be nice if they just left it outside still.. Would make looking around a lot easier.</i>
	Caleb: I guess it isn't the biggest deal, ones up there don't seem to have as many issues or require repairs.
	Caleb_Annoyed: Trust me, <color=#813408>Farida</color> doesn't let me hear the end of it when they go out.
	Chance_Thinking: Why do the ones down here need more repair than the ones on the roofs? 
	Caleb: Oh plenty o' things, more foot traffic, some little critters, bugs. The kids running around and playing sports mostly.
	Caleb_Smile: I don't mind it though, as long as my <color=#813408>Calli</color> is having a good time, I'll spend all day fixing these things.
