- Amount of power
	Chance_Thinking: How much energy do you guys actually get from these? There's lots of trees around and it's really hilly. Isn't that a bad thing?
	Caleb_Thinking: Well, you're not far off. I'm not sure the exact numbers, you'd have to ask <color=#813408>Farida</color> about the specifics.
	Caleb_Smile: But they work well enough I'd say. Don't have any issues with power at night or when the nights get longer in the winter.
	Caleb_Annoyed: Despite what <color=#813408>Farida</color> might harp on about, our energy usage seems to be just fine to me.
	Chance_Thinking: Back home the power would sometimes skip out during the winter because of a lack of sunlight. Weird it isn't an issue here.
	Caleb: Ooo, those musta been cold winters.
	Chance: Not really, I lived on an island. It was very tropical.
	Caleb_Smile: Boy, are you in for a treat.
	Chance_Thinking: What does that mean?
	Caleb_Wink: Ever seen the thermometer go below zero?
	Chance_Scared: That's possible?!
	Caleb_Smile: This is gonna be a fun season comin' up. You are gonna love it.
- Ones on the roofs
	Chance_Thinking: I haven't seen a ladder around, how do you get to the ones on the roofs?
	Caleb: Oh we have a ladder. I just have to haul it out every time to use it.
	Chance: Why not just leave it outside?
	Caleb_Annoyed: Because <b>someone</b> kept taking the ladder and using it to get over the fences into the closed areas. And <color=#813408>Farida</color> makes me keep it locked away now.
	Chance_Annoyed: Oh.
	<i>Man it would be nice if they just left it outside still.. Would make looking around a lot easier.</i>
	Caleb: I guess it isn't the biggest deal, ones up there don't seem to have as many issues or require repairs.
	Caleb_Annoyed: Trust me, <color=#813408>Farida</color> doesn't let me hear the end of it when they go out.
	Chance_Thinking: Why do the ones down here need more repair than the ones on the roofs? 
	Caleb: Oh plenty of things. More foot traffic, some little critters, bugs, the kids runnin' around and playin' sports mostly.
	Caleb_Smile: I don't mind it though, as long as my <color=#813408>Calli</color> is having a good time, I'll spend all day fixing these things.

- Other than solar panels
	Chance: Do you do work on things other than the solar panels?
	Caleb: Sure, I do just about anything electrical around here. I can also do a good bit of work on mechanical things, I fix up the mower when it needs it.
	Caleb: Sometimes that bird kid brings me things he finds outside and I fix 'em for him.
	Chance_Thinking: Outside? Like, outside this main fence?
	Caleb_Smile: Yep, that trouble kid I mentioned earlier. He doesn't bring me many electronics really, but sometimes he finds a broken puzzle or a flashlight or something and I get it workin' for him.
	Chance_Annoyed: Isn't it against the rules to go outside of the fencing?
	Caleb: Sure is.
	Chance: And you just don't say anything about it?
	Caleb_Thinking: Well I'm of the belief that what don't kill ya builds character!
	Caleb_Smile: Besides, I love knowing someone is breaking Farida's rules.
- Line of work
	Chance_Thinking: How exactly did you get into electrical work? Did they have like, electric school or something where you're from?
	Caleb_Smile: Ehh, something like that, yeah!
	Caleb: The compound I'm from originally is based around the idea of providing workers with knowledge to the other compounds. There are a few like that, much bigger than this little place.
	Caleb_Thinking: Well as you get older they sort of do little tests and assessments and all that, and then encourage you down a career path they think you'll like. I got placed into the electrician line when I was sixteen, and the rest is history.
	Chance: And you liked it?
	Caleb: Well I didn't know much else, and I like workin' with my hands. It was nice to give back to my community, and know that one day I'd bring that somewhere else and spread the knowledge.
	Caleb_Smile: And one day <color=#813408>Calli</color> will pick it up too, and maybe she'll move or pass it on to her own kids!
	Chance_Thinking: What if she doesn't want to be an electrician?
	Caleb_Thinking: I'm not sure, I haven't thought too much about it. She'll pick something up here, she loves <color=#813408>Francisco</color> so maybe it'll be biology or something.
	Caleb_Smile: As long as she's happy, I don't mind a bit.
	Caleb: But giving back to your community is important! It's what keeps all this workin', keeps us all alive.
	Caleb_Thinking: What are you going to do 'round here anyway? 
	Chance_Sigh: I don't know.
	Chance_Annoyed: I haven't been placed yet, <color=#813408>Farida</color> will assign me in a few weeks or something based on the report C.A.N. sent. 
	Caleb_Smile: Well let's hope it isn't the head of the fashion police!
	Chance_Sigh: We are both wearing like the exact same clothes.
	Caleb_Annoyed: I would not be caught dead in cargo shorts, kid.

- Your daughter
	Chance: So, why isn't your daughter out here with you?
	Caleb_Thinking: Well that's a good question.
	Caleb: Or it would be, if she wasn't 5.
	Chance: Oh.
	Caleb_Smile: She spends her time with those little rabbit twins and <color=#813408>Jazmyne</color> while I'm working.
	Chance_Thinking: Uh, does she not have someone else to take care of her? Like, your.. partner?
	Caleb_Annoyed: No, she doesn't.
	Chance: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ask something touchy.
	Caleb_Annoyed: It ain't your fault kid. The work program on the compound I come from applies to everyone, and when you get sent out that doesn't necessarily mean your partner gets sent with you.
	Caleb_Annoyed: When I was chosen to become the electrician here, my wife's role was already accounted for by someone named <color=#813408>Philomena</color>. And then, when she couldn't do the job anymore, they sent <color=#813408>Farida</color> instead.
	Chance_Thinking: Is that why you two don't get along?
	Caleb_Annoyed: Let's not talk about this anymore, kid.
- Your family
	Chance: Does your whole family live here?
	Caleb: Nope, just me, <color=#813408>Calliope</color>, and <color=#813408>Francisco</color>.
	if FranciscoTaskOffered == true:
		Chance_Thinking: Is that why Francisco calls you uncle?
	else:

	Chance: You don't look related.
	Caleb_Annoyed: What's that supposed to mean?
	Chance_Thinking: Uh-
	Caleb_Smile: I'm just messing with you kid! No, he's not my biological nephew. I was friends with his parents back on our home compound.
	Chance_Annoyed: Uh huh.
	Caleb: We just got lucky when we got sent to the same compound. <color=#813408>Calliope</color> is elated to have her cousin <color=#813408>Francisco</color> here.
	Chance_Smile: It must've made it easier to transition into living here, having a familiar face.
	Caleb_Smile: It sure did.
	Caleb_Annoyed: As much as it could with leaving her mother behind, anyway.
	Chance_Thinking: Um.. Has she settled in fine aside from that?
	Caleb: Oh sure, she's the smartest little lady there could be! She can take any problem by the horns and flip it on its head.
	Caleb_Smile: She'll be running this whole place one day, mark my words.
	Chance: I'll be sure to follow her political career.

Caleb_Smile: Back again! Either I have some wealth of knowledge, or you have nothing better to do.
Chance_Annoyed: I'm sure you can figure out which one.
- Where you're from
	Chance: What was it like on the compound you were from before?
	Caleb_Smile: Oh it was great! Everyone knew everyone, lots of people. I'm from an island that used to be a large city, so there's lots of big buildings that we repurposed.
	Chance_Smile: I'm from an island too, but no big city. How did you guys grow food?
	Caleb: Well we relied a lot on the ocean for fish, and as opposed to traditional farming most of our food was grown in underground labs. Think lots and lots of mushrooms.
	Chance_Thinking: Moving here must've been a big change.
	Caleb_Thinking: Yeah, you could say that. The people sure are different, but that doesn't really say anything about them.
	Caleb: Most of the people on this compound now didn't come from compounds like mine, so there's a lot to learn about the different places and walks of life out there. 
	Caleb_Thinking: It was hard at first. To move from an area so focused on a singular goal of training and learning, to somewhere that is a lot more focused on just living.
	Caleb: It's a lot more relaxed, but also sometimes I get that itch for a little bit more routine..
	Chance: Did you get a choice about moving?
	Caleb: Nah, not how things work up there. We are raised to be the rejuvenating force that brings education and craft back to the country. They hope that with those skills spread out, we might all be able to reconnect one day.
	Caleb_Smile: Besides, as long as I'm with my <color=#813408>Calli</color> I'll survive.
- What's with the goggles
	Chance_Thinking: So why are you wearing big goggles right now?
	Caleb_Annoyed: What do you mean? Eye protection is very serious, you know.
	Caleb: Any person, any time, you lose an eye, BAM. You gotta spend time learning how to see without depth perception, and depending on how you lose it you might need to pop that sucker out.
	Chance_Sigh: Ew!
	Caleb: I watched a man who didn't believe in eye protection get a piece of metal lodged into his eye while shaping some rebar. We had to carry him to the medical station, and then hold him down while the doc tried to get the piece out.
	Caleb_Annoyed: Man wouldn't stop moving, doc made one wrong move and <b>POP!</b> Had to hold him down even longer while the doctor scooped out his deflated eyeball and sew his eyelid shut to protect the hole.
	Chance_Scared: I'm gonna hurl...
