Yule: Yes, I know about it.
Chance: . . . Could you tell me about it?
Yule: Sure, I can. Not right now, though. I’m busy.
Chance: Doing… what, exactly?
Yule: Fishing.
Chance: Uh, with what?
Yule: A rod, ideally.
Chance: I don’t see one.
Yule: I don’t have one.
Chance: . . . Do you need one?
Yule: Yep, that’s the problem.
Chance: What happened to your old one?
Yule: An unruly fish took it from me years ago. I’ve been net fishing since but, the urge beset upon me once again.
Chance: So… If you get one, will you no longer be busy?
Yule: That makes sense.
Chance: Do you want me to get you one?
Yule: Do you want to get me one?
-Yes.
	Chance: If it will make you not busy, then yes.
	Yule: If you say so. 
	Chance: Uh, what do I need to make you a fishing rod?
	Yule: Oh let’s see… A young flexible branch for the rod, some wire for the guides, and some fiber for line.
	Chance: And I can find all that here?
	Yule: Should be able to.
